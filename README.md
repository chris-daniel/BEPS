# BEPS MVP

## Front end build 
### 20/05/2019

#### Following the technical requires set out by the OCED these pages are:

- Built using LESS 
- Used only 1 CSS file
- Built using the Bootstrap v3.4.1 grid system (we've used an older version to allow for the use of LESS, new versions are built using SASS)
- Unused Bootstrap files haven't been removed at this stage
- Javascript has been used for interactive elements but isn't relied upon for navigation
- No media mapping file has been created at this time

#### Testing:

- These pages have been minimally tested in modern browsers using [browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/), more testing will follow
- The HTML has been tested with the [W3C validation service](https://validator.w3.org/) but no fixes have been implemented yet
- The CSS has been validated using the [W3C CSS validation service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), no errors were found

#### To-do:
- Prototype content will be removed and replaced with examples to match the template spreadsheet
- JSON format will be agreed and implemented 
- Colour list and media map to be provided
- Language switch to be added
- Search and social media code to be added to repo for implementation by Panlogic
- Animation interactive elements need adjusting to work with responsive site
